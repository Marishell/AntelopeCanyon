        Antelope Canyon is located in Page, Arizona within the U.S. Touristy
        hikes are usually not my vibe, but it's no surprise why this beautiful
        place is becoming increasingly popular. Aside from being surrounded by
        other well known parks such as Grand Canyon National Park and Zion
        National Park,
        <strong
          >Antelope Canyon is made of 2 canyons: Upper and Lower Antelope
          Canyon</strong
        >. Schedule your tour carefully and you may be able to exeperience both
        on the same day! Unfortunately, at this time this beautiful place is
        closed. The land is owned by the Navajo Nation and they will notifiy the
        public once it's okay to begin visting again.
